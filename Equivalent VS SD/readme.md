# Equivalent VS SD

In the first step, I generated 2 (or more) uniform random sources (it doesn't matter its amplitude and its center value). 

After generating I mixed them with matrix A. it began with

Then I wrote 2 function. [MIM](MiM.m) as equivalent one and [SD](SD.m). after running them I compared their SNR.

for MIM, SNR is 70.52 and 48.94. for SD, 70.50 and 48.94 in order to our sources.
